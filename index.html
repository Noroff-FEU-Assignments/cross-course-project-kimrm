      The main thing to remember is to never trust user inputs. Most threats
      comes from users inputting either through forms or the url in the browser.
      Sanitizing all data received from users is a must. This involves
      formatting the text or data received from the user, to remove html, js, or
      other code that may be part of the data received. Also string delimiter
      characters like quotes or double quotes must be removed to prevent SQL
      injection. Other security measures would be to ensure proper
      authentication and authorization by using open standard authorization
      protocols or frameworks. Automatic timeout of user logins should also be
      implemented. You should also ensure that all third-party applications are
      trusted and tested.
